# Github Profile Viewer (WIP)

This project is an implementation of [this app idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/GitHub-Profiles.md) from the [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository.

It consists of a page where you can search a github user and see information about him and his top 4 repositories. I made it as a way to study [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) (had never used it before) and practice UI design skills.

## ‚ö° Demo
You can access it [here](https://github-profile-viewer-diegodvv.netlify.app/)!
